      "description": "A must-read for all those looking to be successful in selling and negotiating. Selling is a skill. Salespeople must learn to be flexible and focus on skill development rather than making sales a step-by-step process or a tool. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to the task, and rigid and scripted interactions are likely to put off the customer. Selling skills need to keep pace with consumerism traits. Salespeople have to understand consumer needs better and build relationships with customers faster, more so in the post-Covid world. In Don’t Sell, Make Them Buy, R. Mukund, an industry expert who has spent over twenty years in sales and customer service training, helps readers understand human interactions from a salesperson’s perspective. Every sales call, he says, is a challenge to test a salesperson’s skills.With his vast range of experience, he provides effective strategies to make selling to customers an enjoyable and easy experience. The extensive case studies and real-life sales situations the author narrates are guaranteed to help readers develop unique methods to sharpen their selling skills.This is an essential guide for all those keen on creating long-lasting relationships with their customers as well as experts looking to upskill their selling and negotiating skills.",

      "description": "The investment profession is in a state of crisis. The vast majority of equity fund managers are unable to beat the market over the long term, which has led to massive outflows from active funds to passive funds. Where should investors turn in search of a new approach?\n\nPulak Prasad offers a philosophy of patient long-term investing based on an unexpected source: evolutionary biology. He draws key lessons from core Darwinian concepts, mixing vivid examples from the natural world with compelling stories of good and bad investing decisions―including his own. How can bumblebees’ survival strategies help us accept that we might miss out on Tesla? What does an experiment in breeding tame foxes reveal about the traits of successful businesses? Why might a small frog’s mimicry of the croak of a larger rival shed light on the signs of corporate dishonesty?\n\nInformed by successful evolutionary strategies, Prasad outlines his counterintuitive principles for long-term gain. He provides three mantras of investing: Avoid big risks; buy high quality at a fair price; and don’t be lazy―be very lazy. Prasad makes a persuasive case for a strategy that rules out the vast majority of investment opportunities and advocates permanently owning high-quality businesses.\n\nCombining punchy prose and practical insight, What I Learned About Investing from Darwin reveals why evolutionary biology can help fund managers become better at their craft.",
